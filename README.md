# MVC1
Clean example MVC in PHP. The application reads files and displays them one by one. The user can enter values and store them in the database

Program flow:
There are 2 forms on the page. The numbering form on top and then insert form below the image. 

- The numbering form will get the first new record using an ajax call. 
- The insert form will use a normal PHP call to update an image and copy it from one dir to another.
